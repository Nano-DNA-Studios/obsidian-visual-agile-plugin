# Obsidian Agile Project Plugin

Obsidian Agile Project Plugin is a Obsidian Notes plugin meant to make it easier to organize tasks and write notes about them in the Mardkown Editor.

It takes inspriation from Jira with the organization of notes by splitting them into Epics, Stories and Tasks

An Epic is a High Level activity or Project the user can work on. These may take months or years of activity and are meant to represent a large scale project on a high level view

A Story is a group of tasks that are related to a medium scale goal. Stories may take Weeks or days to complete and are used to organize closely related tasks

A Task is a single activity the user will interact with. They are normally represented by a few hours worth of work, or up to a full days worth. Tasks are the lowest level Agile related activity

# How it works
Once installed, the Plugin will request to create a folder structure to store Epics, Stories and Tasks. If not accepected it will request to do so every time the app is opened and the Plugin is still active.

Once the structure has been created you can use the ``Update Agile`` Ribbon Icon to create new Epics, Stories and Tasks. They can be linked together within the modal and a name and description can be populated upon creation aswell as Priority level.

The Agile files can also be created using commands in the Command Palette.
